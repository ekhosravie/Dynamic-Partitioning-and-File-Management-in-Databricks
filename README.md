Today, I'm going to talk about Dynamic Partitioning and File Management in hashtag#Databricks:
Scenario: You have a large dataset that needs to be partitioned dynamically based on certain conditions,
and you want to optimize file management for better query performance.
Solution: Write code to dynamically determine partition columns and values.
Implement a strategy to manage the number and size of files per partition.
